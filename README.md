# What?

A tiny repo that helps me deal with converting images from one format to another and vice versa, or image to text,... In summary, things related to images

# Why?

I'm tired of watching ads to convert it free on some other sites. I'd like to code my own so I can use it at my freedom (and me be broadcast to others ðŸ˜ƒ)

# How to use?
go run main.go [abs/in] [out_fmt_expected]
